Welcome to DirForge!
====================

You're seeing this because DirForge is serving its built-in samples directory.
This is the default when no RootPath is configured.

To serve your own files, set the RootPath environment variable:

    RootPath=/path/to/your/files


Browse the subdirectories below to see how DirForge displays different
file types, folders, and navigation.
